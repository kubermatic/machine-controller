# Container Linux Config Transpiler

The Config Transpiler ("ct" for short) is the utility responsible for transforming a human-friendly Container Linux Config into a JSON file. This resulting file can be provided to a Container Linux machine when it first boots to provision the machine.

## Documentation

If you're looking to begin writing configs for your Container Linux machines, check out the [getting started][get-started] documentation.

The [configuration][config] documentation is a comprehensive resource specifying what options can be in a Container Linux Config.

For a more in-depth view of ct and why it exists, take a look at the [Overview][overview] document.

Please use the [bug tracker][issues] to report bugs.

### Building from source

To build from source you'll need to have the go compiler installed on your system.

```shell
git clone --branch v0.5.0 https://github.com/coreos/container-linux-config-transpiler
